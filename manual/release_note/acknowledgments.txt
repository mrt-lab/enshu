This file is part of the OpenSSH software.

The licences which components of this software fall under are as
follows.  First, we will summarize and say that all components
are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that.

OpenSSH contains no GPL code.

     *                    All rights reserved
     *
     * As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
     * can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
     * software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
     * incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
     * called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

    [Tatu continues]
     *  However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
     * copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
     * are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
     * source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
     * and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
     * restrictive); see below for details.

    [However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time.  All of
    these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about
    have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,

     - RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library
     - IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated
     - DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library
     - GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL
     - Zlib is now external, in a library
     - The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included
     - TSS has been removed
     - MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library
     - RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL
     - Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library

    [The licence continues]

    Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
    software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
    bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
    information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".

    The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
    permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
    You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
    making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
    your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.


			    NO WARRANTY

    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY

 * After relocating the code, the environment variable "loglevel" is

 * + inputpins, outputpins, event and mask registers.
 * - no offset register. sigh.
 *
 * Because of the lacking offset register we must map the whole card.
 * We assign each memory window PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE address space.
 * Make sure there is (PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE * PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_NO

 * sh.c -- a prototype Bourne shell grammar parser
 *      Intended to follow the original Thompson and Ritchie
 *      "small and simple is beautiful" philosophy, which
 *      incidentally is a good match to today's BusyBox.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2000,2001  Larry Doolittle  <larry@doolittle.boa.org>
 *
 * Credits:
 *      The parser routines proper are all original material, first
 *      written Dec 2000 and Jan 2001 by Larry Doolittle.
 *      The execution engine, the builtins, and much of the underlying
 *      support has been adapted from busybox-0.49pre's lash,
 *      which is Copyright (C) 2000 by Lineo, Inc., and
 *      written by Erik Andersen <andersen@lineo.com>, <andersee@debian.org>.
 *      That, in turn, is based in part on ladsh.c, by Michael K. Johnson and
 *      Erik W. Troan, which they placed in the public domain.  I don't know
 *      how much of the Johnson/Troan code has survived the repeated rewrites.
 * Other credits:
 *      simple_itoa() was lifted from boa-0.93.15
 *      b_addchr() derived from similar w_addchar function in glibc-2.2
 *      setup_redirect(), redirect_opt_num(), and big chunks of main()
 *        and many builtins derived from contributions by Erik Andersen
 *      miscellaneous bugfixes from Matt Kraai
 *
 * There are two big (and related) architecture differences between
 * this parser and the lash parser.  One is that this version is
 * actually designed from the ground up to understand nearly all
 * of the Bourne grammar.  The second, consequential change is that
 * the parser and input reader have been turned inside out.  Now,
 * the parser is in control, and asks for input as needed.  The old
 * way had the input reader in control, and it asked for parsing to
 * take place as needed.  The new way makes it much easier to properly
 * handle the recursion implicit in the various substitutions, especially
 * across continuation lines.
 *
 * Bash grammar not implemented: (how many of these were in original sh?)
 *      $@ (those sure look like weird quoting rules)
 *      $_
 *      ! negation operator for pipes
 *      &> and >& redirection of stdout+stderr
 *      Brace Expansion
 *      Tilde Expansion
 *      fancy forms of Parameter Expansion
 *      aliases
 *      Arithmetic Expansion
 *      <(list) and >(list) Process Substitution
 *      reserved words: case, esac, select, function
 *      Here Documents ( << word )
 *      Functions
 * Major bugs:
 *      job handling woefully incomplete and buggy
 *      reserved word execution woefully incomplete and buggy
 * to-do:
 *      port selected bugfixes from post-0.49 busybox lash - done?
 *      finish implementing reserved words: for, while, until, do, done
 *      change { and } from special chars to reserved words
 *      builtins: break, continue, eval, return, set, trap, ulimit
 *      test magic exec
 *      handle children going into background
 *      clean up recognition of null pipes
 *      check setting of global_argc and global_argv
 *      control-C handling, probably with longjmp
 *      follow IFS rules more precisely, including update semantics
 *      figure out what to do with backslash-newline
 *      explain why we use signal instead of sigaction
 *      propagate syntax errors, die on resource errors?
 *      continuation lines, both explicit and implicit - done?
 *      memory leak finding and plugging - done?
 *      more testing, especially quoting rules and redirection
 *      document how quoting rules not precisely followed for variable assignments
 *      maybe change map[] to use 2-bit entries
 *      (eventually) remove all the printf's

 * Description: Broadcom Network Interface Card Extension (NICE) is an

 *              NICE is designed to provide additional functionalities,
 *              such as receive packet intercept. To support Broadcom NICE,
 *              the network device driver can be modified by adding an
 *              device ioctl handler and by indicating receiving packets
 *              to the NICE receive handler. Broadcom NICE will only be
 *              enabled by a NICE-aware intermediate driver, such as
 *              Broadcom Advanced Server Program Driver (BASP). When NICE
 *              is not enabled, the modified network device drivers
 *              functions exactly as other non-NICE aware drivers.

 * Lots of code copied from:
 *
 * m8xx_pcmcia.c - Linux PCMCIA socket driver for the mpc8xx series.
 * (C) 1999-2000 Magnus Damm <damm@bitsmart.com>
 *
 * "The ExCA standard specifies that socket controllers should provide
 * two IO and five memory windows per socket, which can be independently
 * configured and positioned in the host address space and mapped to
 * arbitrary segments of card address space. " - David A Hinds. 1999
 *
 * This controller does _not_ meet the ExCA standard.
 *
 * m8xx pcmcia controller brief info:
 * + 8 windows (attrib, mem, i/o)
 * + up to two slots (SLOT_A and SLOT_B)
 * + inputpins, outputpins, event and mask registers.
 * - no offset register. sigh.
 *
 * Because of the lacking offset register we must map the whole card.
 * We assign each memory window PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE address space.
 * Make sure there is (PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE * PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_NO
 * * PCMCIA_SOCKETS_NO) bytes at PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_BASE.
 * The i/o windows are dynamically allocated at PCMCIA_IO_WIN_BASE.
 * They are maximum 64KByte each...

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Hymod Board Database

(C) Copyright 2001
Murray Jensen <Murray.Jensen@csiro.au>
CSIRO Manufacturing Science and Technology, Preston Lab

25-Jun-01

This stuff is a set of PHP/MySQL scripts to implement a custom board
database. It will need *extensive* hacking to modify it to keep the
information about your custom boards that you want, however it is a good
starting point.

How it is used:

	1. a board has gone through all the hardware testing etc and is
	   ready to have the flash programmed for the first time - first you
	   go to a web page and fill in information about the board in a form
	   to register it in a database

	2. the web stuff allocates a (unique) serial number and (optionally)
	   a (locally administered) ethernet address and stores the information
	   in a database using the serial number as the key (can do whole
	   batches of boards in one go and/or use a previously registered board
	   as defaults for the new board(s))

	3. it then creates a file in the tftp area of a server somewhere
	   containing the board information in a simple text format (one
	   per serial number)

	4. all hymod boards have an i2c eeprom, and when U-Boot sees that
	   the eeprom is unitialised, it prompts for a serial number and
	   ethernet address (if not set), then transfers the file created
	   in step 3 from the server and initialises the eeprom from its
	   contents

What this means is you can't boot the board until you have allocated a serial
number, but you don't have to type it all twice - you do it once on the web
and the board then finds the info it needs to initialise its eeprom. The
other side of the coin is the reading of the eeprom and how it gets passed
to Linux (or another O/S).

To see how this is all done for the hymod boards look at the code in the
"board/hymod" directory and in the file "include/asm/hymod.h". Hymod boards
can have a mezzanine card which also have an eeprom that needs allocating,
the same process is used for these as well - just a different i2c address.

Other forms provide the following functions:

	- browsing the board database
	- editing board information (one at a time)
	- maintaining/browsing a (simple) per board event log

You will need: MySQL (I use version 3.23.7-alpha), PHP4 (with MySQL
support enabled) and a web server (I use Apache 1.3.x).

I originally started by using phpMyBuilder (http://kyber.dk/phpMyBuilder)
but it soon got far more complicated than that could handle (but I left
the copyright messages in there anyway). Most of the code resides in the
common defs.php file, which shouldn't need much alteration - all the work
will be in shaping the front-end php files to your liking.

Here's a quick summary of what needs doing to use it for your boards:

1. get phpMyAdmin (http://phpwizard.net/projects/phpMyAdmin/) - it's an
   invaluable tool for this sort of stuff (this step is optional of course)

2. edit "bddb.css" to your taste, if you could be bothered - I have no
   idea what is in there or what it does - I copied it from somewhere else
   ("user.css" from the phpMyEdit (http://phpmyedit.sourcerforge.net) package,
   I think) - I figure one day I'll see what sort of things I can change
   in there.

3. create a mysql database - call it whatever you like

4. edit "create_tables.sql" and modify the "boards" table schema to
   reflect the information you want to keep about your boards. It may or
   may not be easier to do this and the next step in phpMyAdmin. Check out
   the MySQL documentation at http://www.mysql.com/doc/ in particular the
   column types at http://www.mysql.com/doc/C/o/Column_types.html - Note
   there is only support for a few data types:

	int		- presented as an html text input
	char/text	- presented as an html text input
	date		- presented as an html text input
	enum		- presented as an html radio input

   I also have what I call "enum_multi" which is a set of enums with the
   same name, but suffixed with a number e.g. fred0, fred1, fred2. These
   are presented as a number of html select's with a single label "fred"
   this is useful for board characteristics that have multiple items of
   the same type e.g. multiple banks of sdram.

5. use the "create_tables.sql" file to create the "boards" table in the
   database e.g. mysql dbname < create_tables.sql

6. create a user and password for the web server to log into the MySQL
   database with; give this user select, insert and update privileges
   to the database created in 3 (and delete, if you want the "delete"
   functions in the edit forms to work- I have this turned off). phpMyAdmin
   helps in this step.

7. edit "config.php" and set the variables: $mysql_user, $mysql_pw, $mysql_db,
   $bddb_cfgdir and $bddb_label - keep the contents of this file secret - it
   contains the web servers username and password (the three $mysql_* vars
   are set from the previous step)

8. edit "defs.php" and a. adjust the various enum value arrays and b. edit
   the function "pg_foot()" to remove my email address :-)

9. do major hacking on the following files: browse.php, doedit.php, donew.php,
   edit.php and new.php to reflect your database schema - fortunately the
   hacking is fairly straight-forward, but it is boring and time-consuming.

These notes were written rather hastily - if you find any obvious problems
please let me know.

    Support for LinkStation / KuroBox HD and HG PPC models

    This patch is based on the port by Mihai Georgian (see linkstation.c for
    Copyright information) and implements support for LinkStation / KuroBox HD
    and HG PPC models from Buffalo Technology, whereby HD is deactivated at
    the moment, pending network driver fixing.

    Notice to users: this is pretty much a barebone port. Support for network
    on HG models is already in the U-Boot mainline, but you might also want
    patches to switch fan / phy modes depending on the negotiated ethernet
    parameters. This patch also doesn't support console switching, booting EM
    mode, Buffalo specific ext2 magic number. So, if you want to use any of
    those, you need additional patches. Otherwise this patche provides a fully
    functional u-boot with a network console on your system.

			- Fixed the driver to work with DM9000A.
			  (check on ISR receive status bit before reading the
			  FIFO as described in DM9000 programming guide and
			  application notes)
			- Added autodetect of databus width.
			- Made debug code compile again.
			- Adapt eth_send such that it matches the DM9000*
			  application notes. Needed to make it work properly
			  for DM9000A.
			- Adapted reset procedure to match DM9000 application
			  notes (i.e. double reset)
			- some minor code cleanups
			These changes are tested with DM9000{A,EP,E} together
			with a 200MHz Atmel AT91SAM9261 core

*
* Description:	This file contains the code to implement the primitive
*		machine operations used by the emulation code in ops.c
*
* Carry Chain Calculation
*
* This represents a somewhat expensive calculation which is
* apparently required to emulate the setting of the OF343364 and AF flag.
* The latter is not so important, but the former is.  The overflow
* flag is the XOR of the top two bits of the carry chain for an
* addition (similar for subtraction).  Since we do not want to
* simulate the addition in a bitwise manner, we try to calculate the
* carry chain given the two operands and the result.
*
* So, given the following table, which represents the addition of two
* bits, we can derive a formula for the carry chain.
*
* a   b	  cin	r     cout
* 0   0	  0	0     0
* 0   0	  1	1     0
* 0   1	  0	1     0
* 0   1	  1	0     1
* 1   0	  0	1     0
* 1   0	  1	0     1
* 1   1	  0	0     1
* 1   1	  1	1     1
*
* Construction of table for cout:
*
* ab
* r  \	00   01	  11  10
* |------------------
* 0  |	 0    1	   1   1
* 1  |	 0    0	   1   0
*
* By inspection, one gets:  cc = ab +  r'(a + b)
*
* That represents alot of operations, but NO CHOICE....
*
* Borrow Chain Calculation.
*
* The following table represents the subtraction of two bits, from
* which we can derive a formula for the borrow chain.
*
* a   b	  bin	r     bout
* 0   0	  0	0     0
* 0   0	  1	1     1
* 0   1	  0	1     1
* 0   1	  1	0     1
* 1   0	  0	1     0
* 1   0	  1	0     0
* 1   1	  0	0     0
* 1   1	  1	1     1
*
* Construction of table for cout:
*
* ab
* r  \	00   01	  11  10
* |------------------
* 0  |	 0    1	   0   0
* 1  |	 1    1	   1   0
*
* By inspection, one gets:  bc = a'b +	r(a' + b)

*
* Language:		ANSI C
* Environment:	Any
* Developer:	Kendall Bennett
*
* Description:	This file includes subroutines to implement the decoding
*		and emulation of all the x86 processor instructions.
*
* There are approximately 250 subroutines in here, which correspond
* to the 256 byte-"opcodes" found on the 8086.	The table which
* dispatches this is found in the files optab.[ch].
*
* Each opcode proc has a comment preceeding it which gives it's table
* address.  Several opcodes are missing (undefined) in the table.
*
* Each proc includes information for decoding (DECODE_PRINTF and
* DECODE_PRINTF2), debugging (TRACE_REGS, SINGLE_STEP), and misc
* functions (START_OF_INSTR, END_OF_INSTR).
*
* Many of the procedures are *VERY* similar in coding.	This has
* allowed for a very large amount of code to be generated in a fairly
* short amount of time (i.e. cut, paste, and modify).  The result is
* that much of the code below could have been folded into subroutines
* for a large reduction in size of this file.  The downside would be
* that there would be a penalty in execution speed.  The file could
* also have been *MUCH* larger by inlining certain functions which
* were called.	This could have resulted even faster execution.	 The
* prime directive I used to decide whether to inline the code or to
* modularize it, was basically: 1) no unnecessary subroutine calls,
* 2) no routines more than about 200 lines in size, and 3) modularize
* any code that I might not get right the first time.  The fetch_*
* subroutines fall into the latter category.  The The decode_* fall
* into the second category.  The coding of the "switch(mod){ .... }"
* in many of the subroutines below falls into the first category.
* Especially, the coding of {add,and,or,sub,...}_{byte,word}
* subroutines are an especially glaring case of the third guideline.
* Since so much of the code is cloned from other modules (compare
* opcode #00 to opcode #01), making the basic operations subroutine
* calls is especially important; otherwise mistakes in coding an
* "add" would represent a nightmare in maintenance.

 *

 * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as
 * published by the Free Software Foundation.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * When nand_scan_bbt is called, then it tries to find the bad block table
 * depending on the options in the bbt descriptor(s). If a bbt is found
 * then the contents are read and the memory based bbt is created. If a
 * mirrored bbt is selected then the mirror is searched too and the
 * versions are compared. If the mirror has a greater version number
 * than the mirror bbt is used to build the memory based bbt.
 * If the tables are not versioned, then we "or" the bad block information.
 * If one of the bbt's is out of date or does not exist it is (re)created.
 * If no bbt exists at all then the device is scanned for factory marked
 * good / bad blocks and the bad block tables are created.
 *
 * For manufacturer created bbts like the one found on M-SYS DOC devices
 * the bbt is searched and read but never created
 *
 * The autogenerated bad block table is located in the last good blocks
 * of the device. The table is mirrored, so it can be updated eventually.
 * The table is marked in the oob area with an ident pattern and a version
 * number which indicates which of both tables is more up to date.
 *
 * The table uses 2 bits per block
 * 11b:	block is good
 * 00b:	block is factory marked bad
 * 01b, 10b:	block is marked bad due to wear
 *
 * The memory bad block table uses the following scheme:
 * 00b:		block is good
 * 01b:		block is marked bad due to wear
 * 10b:		block is reserved (to protect the bbt area)
 * 11b:		block is factory marked bad
 *
 * Multichip devices like DOC store the bad block info per floor.
 *
 * Following assumptions are made:
 * - bbts start at a page boundary, if autolocated on a block boundary
 * - the space necessary for a bbt in FLASH does not exceed a block boundary
 *

 * Lots of code copied from:
 *
 * m8xx_pcmcia.c - Linux PCMCIA socket driver for the mpc8xx series.
 * (C) 1999-2000 Magnus Damm <damm@bitsmart.com>
 *
 * "The ExCA standard specifies that socket controllers should provide
 * two IO and five memory windows per socket, which can be independently
 * configured and positioned in the host address space and mapped to
 * arbitrary segments of card address space. " - David A Hinds. 1999
 *
 * This controller does _not_ meet the ExCA standard.
 *
 * m8xx pcmcia controller brief info:
 * + 8 windows (attrib, mem, i/o)
 * + up to two slots (SLOT_A and SLOT_B)
 * + inputpins, outputpins, event and mask registers.
 * - no offset register. sigh.
 *
 * Because of the lacking offset register we must map the whole card.
 * We assign each memory window PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE address space.
 * Make sure there is (PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE * PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_NO
 * * PCMCIA_SOCKETS_NO) bytes at PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_BASE.
 * The i/o windows are dynamically allocated at PCMCIA_IO_WIN_BASE.
 * They are maximum 64KByte each...

 * Lots of code copied from:

 * m8xx_pcmcia.c - Linux PCMCIA socket driver for the mpc8xx series.
 * (C) 1999-2000 Magnus Damm <damm@bitsmart.com>
 *
 * "The ExCA standard specifies that socket controllers should provide
 * two IO and five memory windows per socket, which can be independently
 * configured and positioned in the host address space and mapped to
 * arbitrary segments of card address space. " - David A Hinds. 1999
 *
 * This controller does _not_ meet the ExCA standard.
 *
 * m8xx pcmcia controller brief info:
 * + 8 windows (attrib, mem, i/o)
 * + up to two slots (SLOT_A and SLOT_B)
 * + inputpins, outputpins, event and mask registers.
 * - no offset register. sigh.
 *
 * Because of the lacking offset register we must map the whole card.
 * We assign each memory window PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE address space.
 * Make sure there is (PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_SIZE * PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_NO
 * * PCMCIA_SOCKETS_NO) bytes at PCMCIA_MEM_WIN_BASE.
 * The i/o windows are dynamically allocated at PCMCIA_IO_WIN_BASE.
 * They are maximum 64KByte each...

/*
 * sh.c -- a prototype Bourne shell grammar parser
 *      Intended to follow the original Thompson and Ritchie
 *      "small and simple is beautiful" philosophy, which
 *      incidentally is a good match to today's BusyBox.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2000,2001  Larry Doolittle  <larry@doolittle.boa.org>
 *
 * Credits:
 *      The parser routines proper are all original material, first
 *      written Dec 2000 and Jan 2001 by Larry Doolittle.
 *      The execution engine, the builtins, and much of the underlying
 *      support has been adapted from busybox-0.49pre's lash,
 *      which is Copyright (C) 2000 by Lineo, Inc., and
 *      written by Erik Andersen <andersen@lineo.com>, <andersee@debian.org>.
 *      That, in turn, is based in part on ladsh.c, by Michael K. Johnson and
 *      Erik W. Troan, which they placed in the public domain.  I don't know
 *      how much of the Johnson/Troan code has survived the repeated rewrites.
 * Other credits:
 *      simple_itoa() was lifted from boa-0.93.15
 *      b_addchr() derived from similar w_addchar function in glibc-2.2
 *      setup_redirect(), redirect_opt_num(), and big chunks of main()
 *        and many builtins derived from contributions by Erik Andersen
 *      miscellaneous bugfixes from Matt Kraai
 *
 * There are two big (and related) architecture differences between
 * this parser and the lash parser.  One is that this version is
 * actually designed from the ground up to understand nearly all
 * of the Bourne grammar.  The second, consequential change is that
 * the parser and input reader have been turned inside out.  Now,
 * the parser is in control, and asks for input as needed.  The old
 * way had the input reader in control, and it asked for parsing to
 * take place as needed.  The new way makes it much easier to properly
 * handle the recursion implicit in the various substitutions, especially
 * across continuation lines.
 *
 * Bash grammar not implemented: (how many of these were in original sh?)
 *      $@ (those sure look like weird quoting rules)
 *      $_
 *      ! negation operator for pipes
 *      &> and >& redirection of stdout+stderr
 *      Brace Expansion
 *      Tilde Expansion
 *      fancy forms of Parameter Expansion
 *      aliases
 *      Arithmetic Expansion
 *      <(list) and >(list) Process Substitution
 *      reserved words: case, esac, select, function
 *      Here Documents ( << word )
 *      Functions
 * Major bugs:
 *      job handling woefully incomplete and buggy
 *      reserved word execution woefully incomplete and buggy
 * to-do:
 *      port selected bugfixes from post-0.49 busybox lash - done?
 *      finish implementing reserved words: for, while, until, do, done
 *      change { and } from special chars to reserved words
 *      builtins: break, continue, eval, return, set, trap, ulimit
 *      test magic exec
 *      handle children going into background
 *      clean up recognition of null pipes
 *      check setting of global_argc and global_argv
 *      control-C handling, probably with longjmp
 *      follow IFS rules more precisely, including update semantics
 *      figure out what to do with backslash-newline
 *      explain why we use signal instead of sigaction
 *      propagate syntax errors, die on resource errors?
 *      continuation lines, both explicit and implicit - done?
 *      memory leak finding and plugging - done?
 *      more testing, especially quoting rules and redirection
 *      document how quoting rules not precisely followed for variable assignments
 *      maybe change map[] to use 2-bit entries
 *      (eventually) remove all the printf's

v1.2   03/18/2003       Weilun Huang <weilun_huang@davicom.com.tw>:
			Fixed phy reset.
			Added tx/rx 32 bit mode.
			Cleaned up for kernel merge.

--------------------------------------

       12/15/2003       Initial port to u-boot by
       			Sascha Hauer <saschahauer@web.de>

       06/03/2008	Remy Bohmer <linux@bohmer.net>
			- Fixed the driver to work with DM9000A.
			  (check on ISR receive status bit before reading the
			  FIFO as described in DM9000 programming guide and
			  application notes)
			- Added autodetect of databus width.
			- Made debug code compile again.
			- Adapt eth_send such that it matches the DM9000*
			  application notes. Needed to make it work properly
			  for DM9000A.
			- Adapted reset procedure to match DM9000 application
			  notes (i.e. double reset)
			- some minor code cleanups
			These changes are tested with DM9000{A,EP,E} together
			with a 200MHz Atmel AT91SAM9261 core

TODO: external MII is not functional, only internal at the moment.
